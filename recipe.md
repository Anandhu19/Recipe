Step 1 - Grab a sharp paring knife and cut around the stem of the apple, going about 1/3 the way into the center. 




Step 2 - use a spoon at this point to scrape out any seeds or tough bits of core remaining. Repeat with remaining apples.



Step 3 - Grab a baking dish large enough to hold all of the apples and brush a liberal amount of butter on the sides and bottom of the pan.
